#### What does a light do in a brawl?

We target heaviest mechs to lightest based on estimated time to kill (TTK).  On a hot mech, you'll have loads of time to pick your shots.  Patients is virtue, just don't reach resting heat and we'll be fine.  Ultimately, you want to never be on resting heat after you engage the enemy, and you want to always be focusing on the mech that the caller is targetting.

[EMP light work on brawling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imNrfFU_plo): The takeaways are that you have a LOT of time to pick your targets because of how hot this map is, he Radick is never cutting it close to sitting on resting heat.


#### What does a medium do in a brawl?

You basically will be playing hard to get and limiting your exposure time.  It does not take long to get dead as a medium in an 8v8 brawl.  Ideally you'll want one of your light pilots to take agro first and then bug out as the rest of our team kills a medium.  Aim for filling up 50% heat bar fast, even if the primary medium target hasn't been called yet.  If you get hit once early, odds are pretty good that you'll go down first.  Don't die with an empty heat bar and you'll have won the match for us.

#### What does a heavy do in a heavy fight?

Read what mediums do.  Basically, the opposition will treat the heaviest class the way mediums are treated in the first drop brawl.
