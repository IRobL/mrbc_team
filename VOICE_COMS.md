# Common Calls from Congress

## Philosophy
In competitive matches, comms should be kept as clear as possible so important information can be relayed.  The silence should only be filled by movement orders from the commander, and reports from people who have eyes on locations where enemies commonly approach from.  *People making use of the coms should do so in as concisly a way possible so that commands.*

##### Target's letter

##### Priority (this is the same as saying "That guy!!!!!")

##### Chassis

##### Loadout: er-lasers + PPCs, longrange, SRMs, short range, lurms

##### Priority Component:  (shoulders/ side toursos, legs)

##### Grid square, grid edges, grid lines, grid paths ("From H6 to H7").  

##### Elevation levels:  Stay high, stay low, up high, down low.  

##### Orientations:  behind, left, right

##### Distances:  Across the way, up close

### technique:  
* Push left (focus on gaining ground at our left flank),
* hurry left (do not 'set up' firing lines, just push in),
* come about (change your direction 180 degrees),
* roll into them now (move mechs towards the enemy, open fire and push past them forcing them to turn their backs),
* form/ stage/ stack up at XX,
* holding at XX for the assults,
* hook/ hard left (take the path making an aprox. 90 degree angle)
