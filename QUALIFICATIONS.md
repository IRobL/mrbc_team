# Qualifications

### Point System Approach

To increase your liklihood of being scheduled in an MRBC drop, you will be expected to complete a series of challenges.  Each challenge you complete gains you one point.  Challenges **may** be applicable only to the class to which you are applying.  Please expect the most qualified pilots will be fielded for each match, and that skill per class will also be taken into account for the drop; a great heavy pilot with full qualifications will not be prefered as a light pilot over a more skilled pilot with fewer overall qualifications.


#### Challenges

##### Light Assassination
Choose one:
- Kill Congress' Cheetah
- Kill Toaster's Locust

##### Medium Assassination


##### Heavy Assassination
Choose one:
- Kill my timby

##### Assault Assassination

##### Verbal Essay
Consicely explain to us over enjin why the MRBC team would become stronger by seating you rather than alternatives.  You'll be objectively graded based on how quickly you can assure us you're a good choice by thoughtful pointing out your best qualities.

##### Medium challenges
Walk up through theta against a skilled King Crab without loosing 100% of your CT armor.

###### Dakka Challenge
Kill a skilled light pilot's Arctic Cheetah at >= 500 meters before it can do 20 laps across.

###### Scouting Challenge
Kick some serious ass in scouting with me:  Do at least as much damage as me (or more) in a scouting match where we win, and neither of us dies.  In the event that you kick very serious ass, but these criteria are not fully met, a point may be arbitrarily granted to you.
