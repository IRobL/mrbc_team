# Qualifications

### Point System Approach

Sometimes, more people schedule for events than we can comfortably field.  It's ideal for players in the MRBC team to drop in at least 3 of the matches each night.  The fact that we have more players than capacity means we will not be able to schedule everyone for drops in advance.  To increase your liklihood of being scheduled in an MRBC drop, you will be expected to complete a series of challenges.  Each challenge you complete gains you one point.  Challenges **may** be applicable only to the class to which you are applying.  Please expect the most qualified pilots to be fielded for matches, and that skill per class will also be taken into account for the drop lineup; a great heavy pilot with full qualifications will not be prefered as a light pilot over a more skilled light pilot with fewer overall qualification points.

###### Scouting Challenge
Kick some serious ass in scouting with me:  Do at least as much damage as me (or more) in a scouting match where we win, and neither of us dies.  In the event that you kick very serious ass, but these criteria are not fully met, a point may be arbitrarily granted to you.
