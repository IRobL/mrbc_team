# MRBC League Team

```
Name:     Air Force Space Command (Deathstronauts)
TAG:      N/A (DSNT)
Mission:  Eliminate Peace in Space
Method:   Giant Combat Robots
```


## Qualifications

Unlike last season's official MRBC entry, the purpose of the Deathstronauts is to maximize our ranking within the selected division.  Players will be offered a preferred seating based on qualifications and time commitment rather than being logged in during a scheduled match time and not have already played a match.

To qualify, in a 1v1 spar, defeat Congress in his Small Pulse Stormcrow.  Any MRBC valid mech is eligible for use in the qualification match.  You are limited to 3 match attempts per week.  Alternatively, drop in a scouting match, win, and do > 90% of Congress' total damage.

Deathstronauts who have passed the qualification challenge will have ashured seats in MRBC matches:  If they are on time, and scheduled for a match, they play for all of their scheduled matches.  Non-qualified participants will not have priority over those who have passed their qualification challenge.


## Practice

We can't win if we don't practice.  A reasonable amount of practice would be 60-120 mins per week.  We're going to do Scouting when we have < 5 players to practice our positioning.  When we have > 5, we'll switch up to private lobby scrims.

# Playbook

## 4 lights, 4 mediums

#### Overview
Scout -> Stage -> spring -> dip -> re-engage








# Definitions

#### Scouting Phase

In this phase of the game, we have our most mobile lights get eyes on key grid squares.

###### Tasks

* Scout ~10 seconds away from the main group without being seen by the enemy
* Mark their position on our radar
* Relay what chasis are being brought to the fight
* Return to the main group without letting the enemy know where that is
* Brawl

#### Staging Phase

In this phase of the game, you listen to the caller as to where to prepare to engage the enemy force.  You should be thinking about what enemy mechs will be called and what angles you will run your mech so that you don't block the shots of your team mates while maximizing your own damage.

###### Tasks
* Hurry the fuck up and wait :)
* keep ~10% heat level if you can poke (optional)


#### Spring Phase

In this phase of the game, we step up to the enemy, and lay on DPS against the target called.  If we spring before a target has been called, you should maintain about 10-20% heat level just by shooting the heaviest thing you can see.

###### Tasks
* DO NOT TARGET ANYTHING UNTIL A UNIT IS CALLED (otherwise your team mates will become distracted
* Shoot the unit that's been called
* Don't block anyone's shots
* Minimize your exposure to the enemy if you're slow
* Optimize your exposure if you're light and mobile such that we can all get our guns trained on someone
* Fill up your heat bar as fast as you can without ghost heating


#### Dip Phase (optional)

Once we finish a solid kill or too, we may dip out of combat.  Run behind cover with your team, and wait until your heat bar is all good again.





#### Re-engage (optional)

Resume combat after leaving combat as a team.  Our heat bars will be ready for load, and we'll re-establish a primary target just as we did in the spring phase.  If your heat bar isn't ready, tell the coordinator.
